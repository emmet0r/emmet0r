### Hi, I'm Emily! I'm currently the Associate Director of the [Open Source Program Office at UC Santa Cruz](http://ospo.ucsc.edu). 

- 👩‍💻 I'm working on a summer mentorship program for HBCU students called [Contributor Catalyst](http://tiny.cc/catalyst-2025) and I also shepherd a cross-sector interest group called [FLOSS-Mentoring](https://github.com/floss-mentoring/floss-mentoring)
- 👩‍🏫 I previously taught computer science at [Berea College](http://www.berea.edu) while working on my computing education [dissertation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362465203_Leveraging_Novel_Teaching_Domains_Toward_Broader_Participation_in_Computing)
- 🧑‍🎓 I've been lucky to work with some amazing students – you can find a list of my current & past mentees below 
- 🌱 I’m also a [guitar builder](https://aberdeenguitars.com) and [pickup winder](https://epcustompickups.com), and I'm learning to play the drums! また、日本語を勉強しています 🇯🇵
