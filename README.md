### Hi, I'm Emily! I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Open Source Program Office at UC Santa Cruz](http://ospo.ucsc.edu). 

- 👩‍🏫 I previously taught computer science at [Berea College](http://www.berea.edu) while working on my computing education [dissertation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362465203_Leveraging_Novel_Teaching_Domains_Toward_Broader_Participation_in_Computing)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a new summer mentorship program called [Contributor Catalyst](http://www.tiny.cc/OSREcatalyst2024) with Norfolk State University students [@Jordin221](https://github.com/Jordin221/), [@Keymon](https://github.com/), [@Elijah](https://github.com/), and [@SilasVM](https://github.com/SilasVM) (who's returned as an alumni mentor ✨)

- 🌱 In my free time, I’m learning how to build acoustic guitars and ukuleles 🤘🏻
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on making open source more inclusive & supporting diverse student engagement!
- ⚡️ Fun facts: I live in the Santa Cruz Mountains and love exploring with my pup, Daphne + I also build handwound guitar pickups and play/watch live music whenever I can
