### Hi, I'm Emily! I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Open Source Program Office at UC Santa Cruz. 

- 👩‍🏫 I previously taught computer science at [Berea College](http://www.berea.edu) while working on my computing education [dissertation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362465203_Leveraging_Novel_Teaching_Domains_Toward_Broader_Participation_in_Computing)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a new summer mentorship program called [OSRE Catalyst](http://www.tiny.cc/OSREcatalyst) with Norfolk State University students [@thatguyseven](https://github.com/thatguyseven/), [@snwarner22](https://github.com/snwarner22), [@OnexiMedina](https://github.com/OnexiMedina), and [@SilasVM](https://github.com/SilasVM)
- 👩‍💻 I'm also working with Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi student [@Nandinisaagar](https://github.com/Nandinisaagar) on open source outreach to high school students
- 🌱 In my free time, I’m learning how to build acoustic guitars 🤘🏻
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on making open source more inclusive & supporting diverse student engagement!
- ⚡️ Fun facts: I live in the Santa Cruz Mountains and love exploring with my pup, Daphne + I also build handwound guitar pickups and play/watch live music whenever I can
